Standard web (html files) export library for Java. This library contains a set of API to export html files to pdf, gif, JPEG or PNG. The end user of the library can use different implementation favors based upon their needs. Right now, we are planning to provide implementations using PHANOTMJS and Webkithtml2pdf and Webkithtml2image.
